# My First Chapter: Reflections on Nanolumi

# How I get into Nanolumi
 
 That was a long story, how I get into Nanolumi. Before graduation, I have looking out for jobs for around 2-3 months and get offer at Nanolumi. I immediately choose to settle down at Nanolumi because the opportunities to learn in a startup as well as the opportunity to lead a team of SW here. That is supper interesting for a Fresh Grad as me


# Graceful

Jax, CEO, have put a lot of trust in me. Thank you for it if you are reading this

I was a fun drive with my collegues where we deliver goverment-level projects. I have learnt a lot in term of leadership skill here. My leadership style has been a pendulum swing. I started out too loose, hoping to be liked, but the team lost focus. Realizing my mistake, I swung to the other extreme—too strict—and killed their motivation. Finally, the pendulum has settled in the middle. I’ve found a balance that offers freedom within a framework: enough space to create, but clear guardrails to keep us aligned.

In term of technical, I have drove a team of 3 people to delivery a Job Management System to control overall project progress in multiple country, help to plan out inventory better. This is the first time I officially sketch out the skeleton of source code, system design as well as choose the techstack for project. I learnt a lot how to structure it so it is scalable and maintianable. Have tried different things to improve my team development experience like  setup sprints plan and review CI/CD work flow in Azure Devops


# Vibe Code
I joined Nanolumi right at the peak of the 'Vibe Coding' trend. Because I built my skills on fundamentals in my univeristy as well as my intership - not just AI—I could see both the trap and the treasure.

I saw the trap in a 'legacy' repo that was only months old. It was rushed and unreviewed, resulting in AI-generated spaghetti code where the same logic was duplicated ten times. Maintaining it was a nightmare; a single bug meant fixing ten different files.

But I also saw the treasure. When we applied code reviews and strong engineering principles, AI didn't just write code—it multiplied our speed. My conclusion? AI is only as smart as your prompt. If you aren't careful, it amplifies your mess just as fast as it amplifies your success.


# Why I leave a bit early

Being an early-stage leader is a double-edged sword. On one side, I had total freedom to deliver value my way. On the other, I was flying solo without a mentor to guide me. I’ve realized that to reach my ultimate goal—solving problems that impact society at a massive scale - I need to step out of my bubble. I’m moving on not because I failed, but because I’m ready to see how the giants handle high traffic and learn from the best.

# End words

It is fun to work with you Joe, Wei Hong, Jair and WaiMun. Wish you all best. I believe you can drive the project well there. Wish you all the best Nanolumi
